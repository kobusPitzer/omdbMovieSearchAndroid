# CinePhind

This is a straightforward implementation of a series/movie search app for the CinePhiles, thus the name :P.

## Getting the app to run

Clone the repository and gradle sync needed dependencies if needed. Run it through Android Studio and it will work. Needs internet connection.

## Things to make it better

- Add pagination to search calls
- Show favourites in list views
- Favourite filter

### Notes

API key shown in gradle is an example only and will not work.
